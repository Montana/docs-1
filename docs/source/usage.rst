Linking a Cloud Service Provider Account
----------------------------------------
See :doc:`aws`

Starting a cluster
------------------
Once you've linked your cloud service provider account, you just click the "start" button on the
cloud/node element in the workspace. That's it. No, really! The cloud/node element will turn yellow
and provide a little spinny wheel to entertain you. When the cluster is running, the cloud will return
and the element will glow a happy blue color.

Tearing down a cluster
----------------------
Don't need your cluster running all the time? No problem! Hit the "shutdown" button on the cloud/node
element in the workspace. This will automatically tear down all the infrastructure harpoon was using
in your cloud service provider account

.. important::
**WARNING: This will really destroy all of the infrastructure in your cloud service provider account
that was provisioned by harpoon. You can't come back from this aside from starting over, so make sure
you really do want to make everything go away.**
