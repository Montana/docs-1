==========
Docker Hub
==========
As soon as you register an account with harpoon, you can immediately start searching for container
images on Docker Hub; there are no credentials required to perform the search, and you can drag
and drop whatever container image you want into the workspace for deployment. harpoon populates all
the possible "tags" or versions of a container image and you can choose to deploy whichever tag you'd
like by selecting it. You can tell a container image is from Docker Hub because it will have a small
Docker logo in the bottom right corner.

Once you've dragged a container image into the workspace, all you have to do is click "Deploy" and
harpoon will handle the rest. If the container image turns blue it has deployed successfully while
red means a problem has occurred during deployment. You can click the "i" button to see the logs
for the container image at any time.
