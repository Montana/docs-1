Products

While our products currently share 98% of the same source baseline, we currently have two distinct
offerings:

* harpoon SaaS
* harpoon On-Prem

harpoon SaaS
------------
This is a hosted solution online that deploys any software dynamically to an AWS account. You provide
the AWS account and we manage all of the virtual infrastructure and Kubernetes bits through the harpoon
interface. You can access harpoon from anywhere and deploy and maintain your software at your leisure.
harpoon SaaS is a multi-tenant solution that powers many businesses in a hybrid-SaaS model (e.g. our
software, your account).

harpoon On-Prem
---------------
This is exactly what it sounds like. Instead of running a multi-tenant solution in the cloud, we are
providing a single-tenant solution that runs only in your datacenter. Currently, harpoon On-Prem supports
VMWare-based deployments and comes with software that bootstraps 100% of the installation of harpoon
On-Prem itself. It also comes with all the necessary binaries to complete the installation process.
Another nifty feature of harpoon On-Prem is that it runs just fine entirely offline, so if you want to
run it in a completely air-gapped environment, you can!
